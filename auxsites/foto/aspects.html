    <h1>Aspects of a Photograph</h1>
<p>There are many aspects to a photo.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Besides the subject, the thing we are taking a photo of, there are many other variables that affect the end result and look of the photo.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Some of these are for example exposure, which determines how bright the image will be, there is also composition, that determines how the subject is placed in the photo and that establishes a certain look and helps guide our attention in the photo towards the subject. Bokeh or background&nbsp;out of focus effect also helps guide our attention towards the subject. Sometimes this can be achieved with background blur in post, but conventionally it is a side effect of using a lower F-stop number lens combined with a bigger sensor. The next aspect worth mentioning is light. light determines how our subject is lit (background or foreground) it also controls the shadows and balances brightness in our photo. Using soft or hard light correctly is also crucial in determining the atmosphere of our shot.</p>
