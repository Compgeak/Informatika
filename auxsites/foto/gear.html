    <h1>Photography Gear</h1>
<p>Photography gear consists of many different pieces of equipment. The most important would be the camera and its components, followed by the accessories like the camera stand, remote shutter, etc.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Depending on the platform we use for photography our gear differs a lot. With DSLR cameras, for example, we need a lens, whereas, on a phone, the lens is already attached to the camera module.</p>
