    <h1>Photo Editing & Other</h1>
<p>Photo editing and processing is the process of taking the digital data of an image and manipulating it to create the desired result.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Firstly we need to make sure we are using the correct file format for our needs</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When we edit an image we can change parameters such as white balance, tint, contrast, raise shadows and reduce highlights to achieve a higher dynamic&nbsp;range.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Editing can, however, have negatives as is has become a sort of a stigma in today's time</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I guess I would classify as a LR user who sees photoshopped images as not that much of a good thing.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I perfectly stand behind the use of PS and LR for things like white balance, colour correction, split toning, cropping, noise reduction, sharpening, making panoramas, stacking photos for hdr/image averaging, imitating multiple exposures, a bit of retouching for portraits or whatever.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I start having problems with photographers that give the impression they took a picture when in reality it's multiple completely different pictures stitched together to achieve something. Using one image and then replacing the sky, adding a foreground subject in post and so on, removing background clutter is still a bit of a gray area, I don't do it but I can imagine a scenario where you can't get a clean background when making the shot. This is where I start making a distinction between "digital artists" (can't think of a more precise term) and photographers.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It's the difference between capturing something real and editing it to make it more similar to the view of the human eye or changing it slightly to achieve a certain look. To elevate the reality to a higher aesthetic level and presenting that through photography.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>On the other hand, using your photos just as assets, material needed to create a new, different piece of art that is it's own thing and not a tweaked version of reality is not something I could call photography.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Photography is a skill of taking or rather making photos, where a photo gets its value from what it presents and the way it is taken. Once you are at that point you can edit it to give it that slight bit more of dimension, atmosphere and perceived image quality. Photography gives an artistic representation of a captured moment in reality.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In my mind, the skill in photography is not in the process of greatly changing or even assembling photos together in a coherent and believable way to get a stunning result. This gives you a created fictional moment and can no longer be considered photography.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When something like this is presented as a photograph I see that as a bad thing. It is art in its own way, equally valuable but different than photography. When one takes photoshop too far it can be seen as using artificial beauty due to lack of capability to capture the natural beauty and I guess in fashion risking to misrepresent reality.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I think there is a stigma around photoshopping because it is viewed as less genuine than not edited photos and the best possible result is preferred to be achieved in the process of taking the photo and not after the fact. "Sure, you could fix that in post, but the image is going to be more genuine if you do it in real life." This in a way puts the skill of taking the photo above editing it as editing any more than would've been minimally necessary is seen as compensating for a worse shot.</p>
