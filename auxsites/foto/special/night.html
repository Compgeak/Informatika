    <h1>Night Photography</h1>
<p>Night photography is somewhat more difficult because it requires experience with long exposure photography due to low amount of light. We can calculate the maximum possible time before stars no longer appear as dots using the focal length and crop factor of the camera. The actual needed exposure needs to be adjusted based on the ammount of ambient light.</p>
