    <h1>Bokeh & Depth of Field</h1>
<p>Depth of field or DoF for short determines how much the focus changes based on relative distance from our focus plane. With a lower depth of focus, objects away from our subjects will be more blurred than when using a setup with high DoF.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>DoF is determined by the f-stop number, where a lower f-stop will mean a narrower DoF.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Bokeh is a term to describe the background blur caused by narrow DoF. Using longer focal lengths the background will also appear bigger. The quality of lens also determines how uniform and not distorted the blur is.</p>
