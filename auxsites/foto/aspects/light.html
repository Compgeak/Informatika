    <h1>Light & Image Lighting</h1>
<p>Light can be soft or hard, this has an impact on how sharp the shadows will be and also determines the contrast of fine detail on our photo. Using harder light can be good for dramatic atmosphere, whereas, softer light is more suitable for something like portraits.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Light can also have a different balance and normally we should make sure that all the light in out photo has the same white balance.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Of course lite can also differ in quantity so we need to make sure our photo is properly exposed in different brightness conditions.</p>
