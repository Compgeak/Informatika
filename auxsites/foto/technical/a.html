    <h1>Aperture: F-Stop & T-Stop</h1>
<p>F-stop is calculated as the ratio between focal length and the aperture diameter. A more open aperture will allow light from a wider angle difference to enter causing blur in out of focus objects.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The t-stop is used to describe how much light gets through the lens into the camera. A t-stop can never be lower than the f-stop because the lens cannot just generate more light. It is actually typically lower as the glass also blocks part of the light letting less through than theoretically possible.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A wider aperture is usually wanted but that makes lenses bigger and heavier, meaning that there is a tradeoff.</p>
