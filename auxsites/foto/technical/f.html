    <h1>Focal Lenght & Field of View</h1>
<p>Focal length determines the field of view and the size of the lens. A longer focal length will call for a longer lens (with exception of mirror based lenses) and will give us a narrower field of view. This will make the subject appear more close up and is useful for photographying subjects that are small and far away.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A longer focal length will also mean there will be less difference in size change with distance.</p>
