    <h1>Shutter Speed</h1>
<p>Shutter speed is crucial for sports photography. In order to capture a moment without motion blur, we need to use a high shutter speed, but the downside is that using a shorter exposure time will let in less light meaning we need to use a lower t-stop and usually also a higher ISO.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Using longer exposure times if beneficial to the image quality but sometimes not possible due to motion.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In DSLR cameras 1/125 of a second represents the shortest time where the entirety of the camera sensor is exposed at once. This means that we can also use that setting combined with a synchronized flash that can use an exposure as short as 1/8000s to freeze motion.</p>
