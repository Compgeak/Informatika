    <h1>Lenses & Optics</h1>
<p>Lenses determine how the light is projected to our camera sensor. We can define them with f-stop numbers, t-stop numbers and the focal length. Some lenses also have built-in image stabilization.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Besides those We also need to be mindful of having the right diameter for our filters and make sure they have the right mount for use on our camera.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In image quality, they also differ based on distortion, color aberration, vignetting and sharpness. That is why certain lenses have such different pricing even if they have the same focal length an f-stop specifications.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Lenses can be classified depending on their purpose. There are wide angle lenses, telephoto lenses, superzoom, portrait lenses, etc.</p>
