    <h1>Filters</h1>
<p>Filters are attachments we use to change how the image taken looks physically. Most common filters are UV filters, polarization filters and neutral density filters (ND filters).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>UV filters block UV light but make little difference to the final photo.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Polarisation filters are used to block light that is polarised in a certain way. This can be very useful to cut reflections of objects like glass or the water surface.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>ND filters block a part of light uniformly. They are used when we need to use a longer exposure time and a low f-stop in a bright environment that would normally cause our image to be overexposed. This is very useful for video where we need exposure times as long as 1/60 of a second.</p>
